  career:
    "I started as a self-taught developer at the age of 14, while I was in 8th grade and it's been a rollercoaster ride since then. Am aka [SkidGod](https://dub.sh/skidgod) on the internet. Won't you ask me what does it mean? [Click here to know](/about).",
  careerFull:
    "I began my journey as a self-taught developer at 14, during 8th grade, and it's been a rollercoaster ever since. Online, I'm known as [SkidGod](https://dub.sh/skidgod), a name that reflects my rootsâ€”starting as an unskilled 'skid' using others' scripts.\n\nBack in 2019, I was just an average school kid with little tech knowledge. When the pandemic hit, everything moved online, and I got a Redmi 8 for attending classes. But, I quickly turned it into a gaming device, getting hooked on ***Free Fire***. This led me to join Discord gaming servers, where I discovered the world of Discord bots.\n\nI met a guy named Priyanshu, the creator of the 'Groot' bot, and got inspired. I spent a year skidding code on Replit, eventually learning Python. I then built a successful Discord bot, 'Floater,' with over 3 million users and 5,000 servers. Despite being bullied for being a 'skid,' I embraced the name SkidGod and started contributing to open-source Discord bots.\n\nAnd that's how my career began.",
