It's all remained as history now! ü•πüò≠ 

It's really heart breaking.

## What is Buildspace?
Buildspace is the place where people build cool shit. Founded in 2019 by [Farza Majeed](https://x.com/FarzaTV). Inshort it's a place for all passionated guys, who just want to work on their idea and show this world what they did.

## How i got into ? 
So one day i was just reading chats on a discord server and they were talking about Buildspace and i successfully ignored them. But they were asking each other to join as buddy and they were wishing congrats to each other. For a while i thought is it a huge thing to get into Buildspace. Till then i was unaware of what Buildspace is. 
then on the last day of Buildspace nights & weekends s5 application deadline i meet a guy on discord who just got into & i just asked him on the dm "what tf is this?" and he just dropped the application link.

And that's how i came to know what Buildspace is. And i just clicked the apply button and i got accepted boom! üî•

## What we did? 
So we were 60k in number and we all have to work on our own ideas for next 6 weeks to graduate. You have to ship your product and submit updates each and every week. After 4th week we recived a mail inviting us to join Buildspace irl in San Francisco. And i was like "WTF" i can't go there. But i was happy for those who were going.
And only 1k out of those 60k were selected to join Buildspace irl. 

They decided to do some pop-up events in different cities and countries. But at the end they cancelled pop-up events due to some reasons. I was really excited to meet my buddies in real life. But its fine.

## What i learned?
I learned a lot of things in Buildspace.
- I learned how to iterate on an idea.
- I learned how to make a toy version.
- I learned how to build a product from scratch. 
- I learned how to ship a product.
- I learned how to pitch your idea.
- I learned no matter what happens you have to keep moving forward.
- I learned how to connect with people.
- I learned how to give and take feedback.

And a lot more. They have a great community. I made a lot of friends there. And i am really happy that i got into Buildspace.
They make sure that you are learning something new in each and every week.

## What's next?
I am planning to work on my idea and launch it. I am really excited to see what's next. I am really happy that i got into Buildspace. I am really happy that i met a lot of cool people there. I am really happy that i learned a lot of things there.

Buildspace changed my life. They thought me a lot in just 6 weeks.

## It's no more now
It's really heart breaking that Buildspace is no more now. They announced that [they are shutting down](https://x.com/FarzaTV/status/1827030900456169849). It's really sad. 
Special thanks to [Farza Majeed](https://x.com/FarzaTV) for creating such a great community.
It's not just a community it's a family. I am really happy that i was part of it.
How can someone forget the memories they made in Buildspace. How can someone forget typing '1' in the chat. How can someone forget those late night sessions.

It's really heart breaking. But it's fine. We have to keep moving forward. We have to keep building cool shits in our life.

## The End
*no matter what - ily buildspace ü´∂üèª*
