In Javascript/Typescript we can do.

```jsx
console.log("Hello World");
```

In Python we can do. 

```jsx
print("Hello World");
```

No no don't worry i was just kidding that's not what i want to speak in this blog. 
I know that if you are reading this then you want to start coding. 

So yeah let's begin & let me know if this works for you!

## What is coding/programming?
It's a process of writing instructions for a computer to perform tasks. It involves creating a set of instructions, called programs, that a computer can follow.

Computers can read different programming languages, each used for different tasks. Some common programming languages include JavaScript, Typescript, Python, and C++.

Inshort if you know how to give instructions to the computer to perform some task then you can perform tasks that you want/imagine. Didn't get me ? Fine i was saying if you can think and you know how to code then you have superpowers in this tech world.

## How i started with a phone? 
So as you know my career story on my [about section](/about#career) i will not repeat the story here. 
So when i was a 'script kid' unknowingly, i used to go on [replit](https://replit.com/) & [github](https://github.com/)
 to find cool discord bots source code.
 
  I also subscribed some YouTube channels for this free source code thing. I remembered when i followed the first tutorial how to clone this source code and where to put you discord bot token 
  i was so happy thinking that it's so easier to have a discord bot. No it's not i was wrong when i found everyone doing the same and i got a lot of hate, my bot was not growing even [Top.gg](https://top.gg/) declined my bot from verification.

  And then someone suggested me to modify the code a bit inorder to pass the Top.gg verification process but i don't even know the 'C' of coding 
  how i will modify the code. And after some time i got a friend on discord who gave me a source code written in python language & when i looked at the code i was able to understand a bit as python is just like english.

  Now i modified the code and passed the Top.gg verification and got a tag of 'Skidder' in the community, lolðŸ˜‚.

  It was so disgusting that the code owner put my name as a skidder on a channel named 'script-kids' on discord. And i was broken. 

  It's not this simple i did this process again & again and i became to understand the python logics. This thing continued for a whole year.

  The intresting part of my story is i started this all on my 8GB RAM phone. Yeah i was doing modifications using my phone and [replit](https://replit.com/).
  Cause at that time i don't have laptop/pc to do proper coding. Don't belive me [replit.com/@skidgodrunz](https://replit.com/@skidgodrunz) is my replit account check this out.

## What i got from this dumb process?
After 1.5 years of skidding i realised that it's not the future. If i love doing this tech things and i want to be a founder of tech product/service i need to do it in a proper way. 
So after a reality check what i did? I opened the YouTube and searched 'How to make a discord bot?'. Not really it's not the way how i begin. I made a friend who knows coding properly in python and whenever i need to make changes in my code i used to ask him what to do and how to do. He helped me alot sometimes even he ghosted me lol. 

But you have to be shameless in this. I will call this process as 'trail & error' because i made errors unknowingly and i learned how to solve the errors and by this i became so proficient that i know what to do next time if i get this error. 

And then i learned the basics of python from YouTube. And in just a day i learned how to code a bot how to make functions in python and all cause i did those things while i was 'skidding' but the major difference was i did everything by copying something and without the proper technical knowledge. And now i know the proper technical terms and methods. 

*That's how you learn something by heart!*

## Deep knowledge ðŸ§ 
It's the same way how your life works. You never know what will be the future you never know the outcome will be in your favour or not. But do you stop doing your work ? No, right?

Exactly just like that you don't need to learn the proper way to do something, Just do something to know the proper way of doing it.

## Suggestions 
Dear, if you want to learn coding i will suggest you start with python just like i did. If you want to copy my whole process then its well and good. But instead of bots you can do other things that you find fascinating and in which you get the community support.

Just see how others do the same thing and ask yourself if you can understand that particular small part of the code, That may be a function or anything.
If you understand it then try to make changes. And am sure 95% of the time you will make errors. That's what we need dude! As i said you need to make errors to learn the correct way of doing it.

And i will suggest you to start with VS Code or any particular code editor and a laptop.
If you can't buy a laptop somehow then don't be sad look at me dude. Look at my journey.
Use your fucking phone and go on.

Don't buy a course in the begning learn everything for free from YouTube.

## The End
Having consistency and motivation to do something is the key of success.
